# Extending

1. Just extend JavaScript class Element and do whatever you want
- Always use _self.gJQ(selector) to get jQuery object

# Background

- Annoyed with the separation of HTML and Javascript?
- C# uses tightly bind objects to HTML blocks, so?
- What if JavaScript could be bind same way?
- Success!
